In what could be a game-changer for mobile technology, a small startup in Helsinki has reportedly developed solar-powered sneakers that can charge your smartphone while you walk.

The shoes, called “SunSteps,” feature tiny flexible solar panels woven directly into the fabric. According to company spokesperson Lina Korhonen, “Just one hour of walking in the sun can give your phone up to 30% battery life.”

Tech enthusiasts are already buzzing on social media, with early photos showing sneakers glowing faintly at night due to embedded LED strips. Some posts even claim that the shoes double as a Wi-Fi hotspot, though the company has yet to confirm this feature.

Skeptics, however, question the practicality of the invention. “It sounds cool, but unless these shoes survive a muddy festival, I doubt people will replace their power banks,” tweeted one user.

Despite doubts, SunSteps has announced plans to launch a crowdfunding campaign next month, aiming to raise €2 million for mass production. If successful, the futuristic footwear could hit European markets by early 2026.

India Launches New High-Speed Rail Between Mumbai and Ahmedabad

Mumbai — India’s first high-speed rail corridor officially opened today, connecting Mumbai and Ahmedabad with trains capable of reaching speeds of 320 km/h. The project, often referred to as the “bullet train,” was inaugurated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi alongside Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida, whose country provided technical expertise and funding assistance.

The 508-kilometer corridor is expected to cut travel time between the two cities from nearly seven hours to just over two. Officials said the first phase of the project will begin with limited daily services, gradually expanding over the next six months.

“This is not just a rail project, but a symbol of India’s modernization and strong partnership with Japan,” Modi said during the ceremony in Mumbai.

The $17 billion project has faced delays due to land acquisition challenges and the COVID-19 pandemic, but experts say its completion could mark a turning point for India’s transportation infrastructure.

Economists estimate that the corridor could generate thousands of jobs and boost regional trade by improving connectivity between two of India’s most industrialized states.

Moderna's Updated COVID-19 Vaccine Shows Strong Immune Response in Older Adults

Cambridge, MA — Moderna announced that its updated next-generation COVID-19 vaccine, mNEXSPIKE, has demonstrated a robust immune response in adults aged 65 and over, as well as in individuals aged 12 to 64 with underlying risk conditions.

Preliminary data from an ongoing post-marketing study revealed a more than 16-fold increase in neutralizing antibodies against the LP.8.1 variant, which is growing in global prevalence. The vaccine's safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity were deemed consistent with previous studies.

Approved by the U.S. FDA in May 2025, mNEXSPIKE is the first COVID-19 vaccine to meet the regulator’s new, stricter requirements, including mandated clinical trials for annual boosters in healthy individuals under 65. Moderna is focusing on new mRNA vaccines amid declining demand for its original shot, Spikevax, and underwhelming sales of its RSV vaccine. Both Spikevax and mNEXSPIKE versions for the 2025-2026 season demonstrate strong immune responses against current major COVID-19 strains, according to the company.
